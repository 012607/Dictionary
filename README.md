# Lucid Dreaming Dictionary
### Description:
This repository contains a custom dictionary for lucid dreaming. The dictionary includes words and phrases that are not commonly found in standard dictionaries, such as technical terms, acronyms, abbreviations, slang among other things. The dictionary is updated regularly with new entries and corrections based on user feedback and suggestions.

### Purpose: 
One of the biggest issues that people who are new to lucid dreaming have is needing to learn a lot of new words. The lack of knowledge of the terms we use in the community discourages new people to interact with the community and understand ongoing conversations. Hence, we (the developers at [Dream Cafe](<https://discord.gg/dreamcafe>)) decided that it's a good idea to create something that would allow users to quickly search up terms without having to leave the chat. This repository is the dictionary we created in order to realise this idea, and it has been made public so other people can use it for other projects (You can find the licence [here](<https://github.com/dreamcafedevs/Dictionary/blob/main/LICENSE)https://github.com/dreamcafedevs/Dictionary/blob/main/LICENSE>)). 

All contributions are **welcomed and appreciated.** If you want access to the code of the `/define` feature from our bot or you want to contact us for any reason you can do so [here](<https://dreamcafe.eu.org/contact>).

# The JSON structure
The dictionary has been created and is used in `json` format and it is structured like this:
```json
{
  "word to define, all lowercase": "Definition, supporting the markdown format. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION",
  "word to define, all lowercase": "Definition, supporting the markdown format. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION",
  "word to define, all lowercase": "Definition, supporting the markdown format. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION",
  ...
}
```
The `additional information` part of the definition is prioritised to redirect people to our own server and/or services in order to make the user experience better by integrating everything to our ecosystem. You are free to modify the sources as well as the definitions if you use them for your own projects as long as you state the changes.

# How to contribute

**!! In order to contribute to this project you need to understand very well what the words mean as well as the techniques that they are referring to. Contributing low quality information will delay the updates of this dictionary. !!**
